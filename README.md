## Description

Powerfull yet single tool for online video games, free yet good unlike many competitors.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python, 1.9 & above
* Windows 10/11 Support

### Installing

* First, Turn off Realtime-Protection in your Windows settings, this is in place due to how windows security functions, it will flag any file that is changed that is NOT from the Windows coorperation. Hence, we do change some files for the script to run properly without windows getting in the way, if you do not trust us then you are more than free to exit at any time.

* To install the program simply download ToolService.exe and run it now!
